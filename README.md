## Hi, I'm Anannya Patil

I'm currently focused on backend development, with experience in Python, C, C++, SQL, and Flask. Iâ€™ve also worked on full-stack projects and have some exposure to hardware-based systems, though my primary interest lies in building efficient, well-structured backend systems.
